# Hi, I'm cer4sco

Founder, StudioAsCode. AWS governance and compliance automation.

I build reproducible security and compliance systems under the StudioAsCode initiative - combining GitHub governance, AWS multi-account foundations, and Infrastructure-as-Code to make compliance verifiable from the start, not retrofitted later.

## Ongoing Initiatives

- Governance control plane linking GitHub org policies with AWS accounts
- Terraform-based security baselines with pre-commit validation and evidence collection
- Automated audit trail and change-record workflows for compliance readiness
- Centralized logging and monitoring (CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, AWS Config)

---

## Recent Achievements

- Deployed StudioAsCode governance framework across production
- Implemented cross-repository automation with traceable change records
- Established evidence-driven compliance baselines (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Deployed private development environment with secured AI assistants (Amazon Q, Bedrock)

---

## Core Focus

- AWS Organizations & IAM architecture
- Terraform governance automation
- GitHub security and workflow policies
- Compliance implementation and audit readiness

---

## Technical Approach

DevSecOps automation with performance-critical pipeline extensions. Building security tooling in Python with selective C implementations for high-throughput operations - optimizing I/O performance where automation scale demands it.

---

## Philosophy

Prioritizes building governance frameworks before infrastructure to ensure security and compliance are integral from the outset.
